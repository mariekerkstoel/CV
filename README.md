####  University (09/2012 to 06/2017)

University of Ghent
Bachelor in Business Economics

During my time at the University of Ghent I developed a variety of crucial skills. My communication, presentation, teamwork and leadership skills stem from the endless amount of group projects and presentations we had to work on. My analytical skills, business skills and ability to learn new material in a short amount of time are due to the endless hours spent learning a diverse collection of subjects. (From advanced math, statistics and economics classes to business informatics and production technology classes to HR and marketing classes.)   

Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne
Erasmus Master (09/2016 - 01/2017)

The months I spent studying in Paris not only improved my french immensely (C2 level) but made me much more independent. Being able to not only keep up with the pace of the economics courses in french but also thriving in some of them, were an accomplishment I didn't know I was going to achieve.
