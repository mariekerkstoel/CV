Hi, I'm Marie, a 23 year old, soon-to-be full stack developer. I offer enthusiasm, focus, commitment, energy and creativity as well as a skill-set that is constantly growing. I am looking to join a team as a front-end developer.   

## Skills

#### Communication and social skills

#### Adaptability

I have never lived in the same place for longer than 5 years. I have learned new languages, made new friends and acquired new skills everywhere I have gone. I have learned to adapt very quickly to any situation.

#### Perseverance

#### Enthusiasm

#### Eye for graphics

When it comes to graphics and the way things are presented, I am an out of control detail freak. I am passionate about being able to control how things look. When I was experimenting with blogging, I could sit hours and hours fixing every detail to make the blog look exactly the way I wanted it to. Having something look good gives me immense satisfaction.

####  University (September 2012 to June 2017)

University of Ghent (Belgium)
Bachelor in Business Economics

During my time at the University of Ghent I developed a variety of crucial skills. My communication, presentation, teamwork and leadership skills stem from the endless amount of group projects and presentations we had to work on. My analytical skills, business skills and ability to learn new material in a short amount of time are due to the endless hours spent learning a diverse collection of subjects. (From advanced math, statistics and economics classes to business informatics and production technology classes to HR and marketing classes.)   

Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne (France)
Erasmus Master (September 2016 - January 2017)

The months I spent studying in Paris not only improved my french immensely (C2 level) but made me much more independent. Being able to not only keep up with the pace of the economics courses in french but also thriving in some of them, were an accomplishment I didn't know I was going to achieve.
