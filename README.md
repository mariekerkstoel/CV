Hi, I'm Marie, a 23 year old, soon-to-be full stack developer. I offer enthusiasm, focus, commitment, energy and creativity as well as a skill-set that is constantly evolving. I am looking to join a team as a full stack junior developer.   

## Skills

#### Communication and social skills
Throughout my education I was part of a few things that improved these skills. I was in the student council for a year, I organised volleyball classes, in Paris I organised weekly training sessions on our campus with my friends. I led many group-works and presentations at university.  
#### Adaptability
Moving to numerous countries throughout my life has taught me how to adapt quickly to new environments. By doing Makers Academy after having finished a business economics degree, I've becoming more confident that this is an essential skill.

#### Perseverance

#### Enthusiasm

## Education

#### Makers Academy (September 2017 to January 2018)

Makers Academy is an intense 3 month course that teaches its students a number of skills. The first thing Makers Academy focusses on is teaching the necessary tech skills to become a junior developer. Some of which I've summarised here:
- Object Oriented Programming
- Focus on Test Driven Development
- Pair Programming
- Full Stack Web Development
- TDD, Ruby, Javascript, Rspec, Rails , .. <br />

I have also gained numerous other skills by taking this course at Makers Academy. I have discovered my own technique for how to pick up new material fairly quickly. I have gained more experience in how to work with other people in a professional environment. This entails knowing how to communicate, what to communicate and when to ask for help.

####  University (September 2012 to June 2017)

University of Ghent (Belgium)
Bachelor in Business Economics

During my time at the University of Ghent I developed a variety of crucial skills. My communication, presentation, teamwork and leadership skills stem from the endless amount of group projects and presentations we had to work on. My analytical skills, business skills and ability to learn new material in a short amount of time are due to the endless hours spent learning a diverse collection of subjects. (From advanced math, statistics and economics classes to business informatics and production technology classes to HR and marketing classes.)   

Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne (France)
Erasmus Master (September 2016 - January 2017)

The months I spent studying in Paris not only improved my french immensely (C2 level) but made me much more independent. Being able to not only keep up with the pace of the economics courses in french but also thriving in some of them, were an accomplishment I didn't know I was going to achieve.

Master in Business Economics: Marketing
