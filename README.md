Hi, I'm Marie, a 23 year old, soon-to-be full stack developer. You've caught me in the middle of my most formative years in which I cannot get enough of everything and anything. I offer enthusiasm, focus, commitment, energy and creativity as well as a skill-set that keeps growing everyday. I am looking to join a team as a front-end developer.   

## Skills

#### Perseverance

Throughout my (short) life I have been pushed/or have pushed myself into situations where none of my natural skills were the required skills. From moving to countries and going to school where I didn't speak the language. To running long races without training. To taking up classes at university that made me regret taking up those classes. To doing an intense four month coding camp without having any experience whatsoever. I am constantly pushing myself and I never give up without reaching my goal. I succeeded at school in those foreign countries, I finished the races, I got through all those classes and I am confident I will get through makers academy and much more. I am not afraid of challenges.

#### Communication

#### Presentation

#### Eye for graphics

In this aspect I am an out of control detail freak. I am passionate about being able to control how things look. When I was experimenting with blogging, I could sit hours and hours fixing every detail to make the blog look exactly the way I wanted it to. Having something look good gives me immense satisfaction.

####  University (September 2012 to June 2017)

University of Ghent
Bachelor in Business Economics

During my time at the University of Ghent I developed a variety of crucial skills. My communication, presentation, teamwork and leadership skills stem from the endless amount of group projects and presentations we had to work on. My analytical skills, business skills and ability to learn new material in a short amount of time are due to the endless hours spent learning a diverse collection of subjects. (From advanced math, statistics and economics classes to business informatics and production technology classes to HR and marketing classes.)   

Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne
Erasmus Master (September 2016 - January 2017)

The months I spent studying in Paris not only improved my french immensely (C2 level) but made me much more independent. Being able to not only keep up with the pace of the economics courses in french but also thriving in some of them, were an accomplishment I didn't know I was going to achieve.
